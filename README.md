# Wordle Clone
The goal of this project is to clone the popular New York Times game Wordle for our Platform Based Computing (CSC 2053) final project at Villanova University. After learning about React we sought recreate the game to reapply the topics we learned about in class. We hope you enjoy perusing these code files!

## How to Interact With Our Repo
The react app is completely contained within the "wordlee" folder. That folder holds the final version of our game. The two CSS files "Caleb's CSS" and Gerremy's CSS" were there for developmental and testing reasons.
