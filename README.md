# Wordle Clone
The goal of this project is to clone the popular New York Times game Wordle for our Platform Based Computing (CSC 2053) final project at Villanova University. After learning about React, APIs, Backend frameworks we sought to combine each of those ideas to recreate the game.

## Code Files
This is placeholding text describing how to access and interact with our game. It'll likely be hosted for free somewhere and a link will be included. It'll also explain what each file does that we upload and the changes we make to all of them.

## Contributions
This section may not stay but in case we want to describe who did what this could be done here.

## Sources
Besides going into depth about the API we used and what platform we host this game on, I'm not sure if we'll need to go into any more detail. It may be nice to detail all the technologies and platforms that we use though.
